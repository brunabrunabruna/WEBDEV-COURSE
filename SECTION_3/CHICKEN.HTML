    <p>
      The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl
      species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon
      junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeast Asia. Rooster and cock
      are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a
      cockerel.H

    <p>
      A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called
      a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep
      chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and
      eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting,
      which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat
      are broilers and for eggs are layers.
